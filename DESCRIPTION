Description: Provides easy access to tidy education finance data combining
    NCES F-33 Survey, Census Bureau Small Area Income Poverty Estimates (SAIPE),
    and community data from the ACS 5-Year Estimates. The package simplifies
    downloading, caching, and filtering education finance data by year and state,
    enabling researchers and analysts to explore K-12 education funding patterns,
    revenue sources, expenditure categories, and demographic factors across 
    U.S. school districts.
